## Hi, I'm Harsh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in computer vision and computational imaging. As a Research Assistant at UC Riverside, I develop physics-inspired deep models, pushing boundaries in perception systems.

I hold an MS from UC Riverside, where I researched thermal optical flow under the guidance of Dr. [Vishwanath Saragadam](https://vishwa91.github.io/) and Dr. [Amit Roy-Chowdhury](https://vcg.ece.ucr.edu/amit), and a BS from PES University.

Previously at Intel, I developed a severity ranking system for ADAS alerts through scene understanding. I engineered a large-scale video analysis pipeline during Google Summer of Code and worked as a research fellow at IISc under Dr. [Anurag Kumar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anurag_Kumar).
